\title{Calculate LHS (Leaf-Height-Seed) Strategy}
\usage{
LHS(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing columns for SLA, Height, and SeedMass.}
}
\value{
A data frame with an additional column 'LHS_strategy' containing the calculated LHS strategy.
}
\description{
This function calculates the LHS strategy for plant species based on their SLA (Specific Leaf Area),
Height, and Seed Mass values.
}
\details{
The function calculates median values for SLA, Height, and SeedMass from the input data.
It then determines the LHS strategy for each species based on whether its trait values are
less than or equal to (S) or greater than (L) the median values.

The resulting strategy is a combination of three letters (S or L) representing Leaf (SLA),
Height, and Seed (SeedMass) respectively, separated by hyphens.
}
\examples{
data(PFF)
pff <- PFF[, c("SLA", "Height", "SeedMass")]
result <- LHS(pff)
head(result)
