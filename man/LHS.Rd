\title{Calculate LHS (Leaf-Height-Seed) Plant Ecological Strategy Classification}
\usage{
LHS(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing plant trait data with the following required columns:
\describe{
\item{SLA}{Specific leaf area (area per unit dry mass, typically mm2/mg or m2/kg)}
\item{Height}{Canopy height at maturity (typically in metres)}
\item{SeedMass}{Seed mass (typically in mg or g)}
}
Row names should represent species names or identifiers.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original columns plus:
\describe{
\item{log_SLA}{Natural logarithm of SLA}
\item{log_Height}{Natural logarithm of Height}
\item{log_SeedMass}{Natural logarithm of SeedMass}
\item{LHS_strategy}{Character string indicating the LHS strategy type (e.g., "S-L-S")}
}
}
\description{
The LHS scheme uses three fundamental plant traits that reflect important trade-offs
controlling plant strategies:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Specific Leaf Area (SLA)}: Light-capturing area deployed per unit dry mass,
reflecting the trade-off between rapid resource acquisition and leaf longevity
\item \strong{Height}: Canopy height at maturity, expressing the amount of growth attempted
between disturbances and competitive ability for light
\item \strong{Seed Mass}: Reflecting the trade-off between seed number and individual seed
provisioning, affecting dispersal capacity and seedling survival
}

All three axes are log-scaled as they are approximately lognormally distributed between species.
Species are classified into eight strategy types based on whether their log-transformed trait
values are above (L = Large) or below (S = Small) the median values.
}
\details{
This function implements the LHS plant ecology strategy scheme proposed by Westoby (1998),
which classifies plant species based on three key functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA),
canopy height at maturity, and seed mass. The LHS scheme provides a quantitative framework
for comparing plant ecological strategies worldwide.

The function performs the following operations:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input data for required columns and checks for missing, zero, or negative values
\item Log-transforms all three traits
\item Calculates median values for each log-transformed trait
\item Classifies each species based on whether traits are above (L) or below (S) medians
\item Returns the original data with added log-transformed columns and strategy classification
}
}
\examples{
data(PFF)
pff <- PFF[, c("SLA", "Height", "SeedMass")]
rownames(pff) <- PFF$species
head(pff)
result <- LHS(pff)
head(result)
