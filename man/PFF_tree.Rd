\title{Phylogenetic Tree of 133 Plant Species from Pine Forest Flora}
\format{
A phylo object (phylogenetic tree) with the following structure:
\describe{
\item{tips}{133 terminal nodes representing plant species}
\item{nodes}{121 internal nodes with taxonomic labels}
\item{tip.label}{Species names including Hymenopappus mexicanus,
Heliomeris multiflora, Bahia dissecta, etc.}
\item{node.label}{Taxonomic group names including Spermatophyta,
eudicotyledons, Pentapetalae, etc.}
\item{edge.length}{Branch lengths indicating evolutionary distances}
\item{root}{Tree is rooted}
}

\description{
A phylogenetic tree containing 133 plant species from a pine forest flora study.
The tree includes both tip and node labels, is rooted, and contains branch lengths.
}
\details{
This phylogenetic tree represents the evolutionary relationships among 133 plant
species found in pine forest ecosystems. The tree structure includes:
\itemize{
\item 133 terminal taxa (tip labels with species names)
\item 121 internal nodes with higher-level taxonomic classifications
\item Branch lengths representing evolutionary time or genetic distance
\item Root indicating the common ancestor of all included species
}

The tree was constructed as part of a comprehensive study examining plant
functional strategies in pine forest communities, specifically testing the
leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant strategy scheme proposed in functional ecology.
