\title{Create a table of Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) strategy types}
\usage{
LHS_strategy_scheme()
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{type}{Character vector of LHS strategy combinations (e.g., "L-L-L", "L-L-S", etc.)}
\item{strategy}{Character vector describing the ecological strategy for each type}
}
}
\description{
This function generates a data frame containing different plant growth strategies
based on the Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) scheme. Each strategy is described by a
combination of traits and their corresponding ecological interpretation.
